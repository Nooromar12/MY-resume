<h1>Hoppies:</h1>
<p>I have lots' of different hoppies the following are my favarite hoppies</p>
<ul>
    <li>weight: lifting:
        <p>This is one of my favorite hoppies so far once you get to the level of bulking<br>
        weight lifting become super addictive, but hey it is addiction as you will het stronger</p>

    </li>
    <li> Chess:
        <p>This is another hoppy I really really love, I play it onnline or sometimes play with AI<br>
        most of the time I defeat the Ai but highly rated Ais defeat me<br> the only con with 
    this hobby is that not a lot of people play it</p>
    </li>
    <li>Coding:
        <p>sice I started coding it is now becoming one of my favorite hobbies<br> I
        can say at first learning coding won't really feel like a hobby as it gets hard and challenging.</p>
